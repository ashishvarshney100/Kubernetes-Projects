Debugging a Failing Pod:
============================
Create a Pod named failing-pod that runs a busybox container with a command that exits with an error (e.g., false).
Use kubectl commands (kubectl logs, kubectl describe) to troubleshoot and identify the issue.
Connecting to a Running Pod:

Create a Pod named connect-pod that runs a busybox container. Use kubectl exec to run commands inside the container.
Pod with Volume Mounts:

Create a Pod named volume-pod that mounts a PersistentVolume and writes some data to the volume. Verify the data persists.
Monitoring and Observability
Pod Logging:

Create a Pod named logging-pod that runs a nginx container. Use kubectl logs to stream logs from the Pod.
Using Prometheus to Monitor Pods:

Create a Pod named monitor-pod that runs an application exposing metrics on port 8080. Configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics.
